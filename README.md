First run setup
- If no Java path is configured, the relauncher downloads Java for your OS/architecture and config javaVersion using parallel chunk downloads.
- A progress dialog shows detailed download statistics: speed (MB/s), ETA, percentage, and file count.
- Downloads automatically resume if interrupted - no need to start over!
- The latest Cleanroom Loader release is selected automatically (no manual selection needed).
- All libraries are downloaded in parallel (up to 8 simultaneous downloads) for faster setup.

Configuration
- File: config/relauncher.json
- Key options:
    - javaVersion: desired major version (e.g., 24). Default is 24, minimum is 21. Changing this triggers an automatic re-download and switch.
    - javaVendor: preferred distribution - "adoptium" (Temurin) or "graalvm" (GraalVM Community). Default: "adoptium".
    - javaExecutablePath: set if you want to force a specific Java. If itâ€™s not valid or mismatched with javaVersion, the relauncher will auto-download the correct one.
    - autoUpdate: when true, always selects the latest Cleanroom release on launch and updates the selected version automatically. Default: false.

Cache locations
- Java is cached under: &lt;UserHome&gt;/.cleanroom/relauncher/java/&lt;distribution&gt;-&lt;version&gt;-&lt;os&gt;-&lt;arch&gt;
    - Example: ~/.cleanroom/relauncher/java/temurin-21-windows-x64
    - Example: ~/.cleanroom/relauncher/java/graalvm-22-linux-x64
    - Example: ~/.cleanroom/relauncher/java/graalvm-24-mac-aarch64

It offers a GUI on the client for manual configuration when the autoconfiguration fails.

Cleanroom Loader is a new loader developed from the roots of Forge Mod Loader for Minecraft 1.12.2 specifically. It boasts better performance, modern Java support, and offers better experiences for mod developers.
