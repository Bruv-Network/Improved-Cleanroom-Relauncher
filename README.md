## Improved Cleanroom Relauncher

Makes the Cleanroom Relauncher a much more seamless experience for modpack users and allows modpack creators to not have to worry about setup instructions! It will automatically download the required java version and cleanroom libraries, and configure it automatically for you!

**Supports only the major Cleanroom versions via GitHub releases at the moment.**

**Supports client-side relaunching, server-side soon.**

Relaunches a Forge 1.12.2 instance with Cleanroom Loader, with a streamlined first-run experience and automatic Java setup.

    - Auto-switch Java when config javaVersion changes
    - Auto-update to the latest Cleanroom release on launch (configurable)
    - Automatic download resuming and retrying

First run setup
- If no Java path is configured, the relauncher downloads Java for your OS/architecture and config javaVersion.
- A progress dialog shows the download status and then the archive is extracted automatically.
- The latest Cleanroom Loader release is selected automatically (no manual selection needed).

Configuration
- File: config/relauncher.json
- Key options:
    - javaVersion: desired major version (e.g., 21, 24). Changing this triggers an automatic re-download and switch.
    - javaExecutablePath: set if you want to force a specific Java. If itâ€™s not valid or mismatched with javaVersion, the relauncher will auto-download the correct one.
    - autoUpdate: when true, always selects the latest Cleanroom release on launch and updates the selected version automatically. Default: false.

Cache locations
- Java is cached under: &lt;UserHome&gt;/.cleanroom/relauncher/java/&lt;distribution&gt;-&lt;version&gt;-&lt;os&gt;-&lt;arch&gt;
    - Example: ~/.cleanroom/relauncher/java/temurin-21-windows-x64
    - Example: ~/.cleanroom/relauncher/java/graalvm-22-linux-x64
    - Example: ~/.cleanroom/relauncher/java/graalvm-24-mac-aarch64

It offers a GUI on the client for manual configuration when the autoconfiguration fails.

Cleanroom Loader is a new loader developed from the roots of Forge Mod Loader for Minecraft 1.12.2 specifically. It boasts better performance, modern Java support, and offers better experiences for mod developers.
